### Discord Integration
The web scraper now has a Discord bot that can extract the ASIN or ISBN of a product from
a link sent in a direct message. To use the bot follow these steps:

1. Invite the bot to your Discord server using this <a href = "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1091094561314582528&permissions=1634235578438&scope=bot">amazonBuddy.</a>
2. Send an Amazon product link to the bot in a direct message.
3. The bot will search the link for an ASIN or ISBN, and respond with the appropriate identifier.
4. If you want to retrieve the product details for a specific ASIN, you can send the ASIN to
the bot in a direct message, and it will repsond with product information.
